# feedback4me

feedback4me is a social media Android application written in Java using a Firebase backend.
It was written as part of the final project for the Mobile Computing Course (year 2 of Parallel and Distributed Computer Systems Master's Degree University Politehnica of Bucharest).

The main purpose of the app is allowing users to share their feedback on other people's pages. The user writing the feedback can share his/her identity or keep it anonymous.
The application itself is more of a mock-up at this stage, although it is completely functional. There are still unfixed bugs, but for the most part, it does work :)
